* motion model 1:
start simple only 3D position, ignore rotation. How?

    *(x,y,z)
                *'(x,y,z)


       V___
           --___V'


1. gets rel target position
2. calcs diff from desired position
3. moves the tool with this error

After this is done:
smoothing:
1. set distance threashold.
2. if within the threashold, do not update!

better speed limits:
1. calc L2 distance and limit by that.

brakeing:
1. keep a "current speed" vector (maybe can get from robot) 
2. if the speed is roughly in the right direction, and we are close(threashold) - slower speed.


motion model 2:
angular - only rotation.

    *(x,y,z)
    |
    |
    | 
    V ----- *

use quaternions!
1. get dir vec from tool to target
2. trans to the desired rot
3. apply step using quaternions.



pixels to (x,y,z):
1. get the x,y on screen space.
2. set the z value (hardcoded or by model)
3. apply inv of the projection (need some camera measurments)
